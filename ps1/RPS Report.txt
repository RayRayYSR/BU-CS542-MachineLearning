First 102 games played by me: 1 tie 3 win 99 lost.
Aparently, the computer easily learnt my pattern at round 4
and took a bold move to predict my 5th round, then each time I 
followed my pattern, the "confidence" of the computer became
more, then it followed my pattern to beat me. I tried to 
change my pattern once, the computer unsurpriseling lost, since
it always followed my "fixed" pattern.

After playing with the program online, I realize that the computer 
can learn my play pattern, so I use the simplest theory to beat AI. 
The amazing Random. (There is no requirement in the assignment which
says I cannot use random or any requirement/restrictions about this
assignment. Thus, I use whatever I like) If the computer would like 
to learn my pattern. There is no pattern for it to learn. Let's leave
the results to God. 
1 represents Rock
2 represents Paper
3 represents Scissors

Second 102 games by my program:  39 tie  36 win  27 lost.
This time the result increases a lot since the random function in Python
(Although random cannot literally be real random, for hundreds of tests,
random is enough to handle and give random output) provides random result
which can hardly be concluded in a pattern.
